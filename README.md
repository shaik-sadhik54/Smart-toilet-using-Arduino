The Smart Toilet is an IoT-based system designed to improve public restroom hygiene, safety, and accessibility. It uses sensors to automate door locking, occupancy detection, and cleaning, while offering voice guidance for blind users and an emergency SOS alert system. A mobile app also shows real-time toilet status.
